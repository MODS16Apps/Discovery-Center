        &#160;&#160;The New River Inn is a historical location built in Ft. Lauderdale in 1905 by the cities first contractor Edwin T. King. \n
        \n
         &#160;&#160;From 1905-1955, the building served as a hotel for the emerging city. In 1972, the site was added to the U.S. National Register
        of Historic Places. In 1976, the New River Inn officially became part of the Museum of Discovery and Science as the
        Discovery Center. \n
        \n
           &#160;&#160;Over time the Museum outgrew this historical building and relocated itself to the much larger facility we know of today.
        The Discovery Center today, is the kid-friendly play area we all know of, but even though it has left its original building
        tributes to its past can still be found. The New River Inn still exists today as part of the Fort Lauderdale Historic Society,
        and can be visited at the River Walk.

        &#160;&#160;This app was created in part by an educational internship initiative at the Museum called Apptitude.
        In this program, students were split into groups and designated exhibits in which they would design an app for.
        Some groups opted to use apps previously created by the museums prior interns, however this one was built from the
        ground up so we could shape it to our vision.\n
        \n
        &#160;&#160;The students who have created this are Jeffrey Schaefer, Brandon Wand, and Angel Ramirez. However not all
        credit goes to them. The fine faculty at FAU, members of the online community Stack Overflow, Summer Scarlatelli,
        and many others have cast their influence here.\n
